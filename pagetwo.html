      <h2> About </h2>
      <section>
        Kitties to Go! was founded in 2012 by two cat lovers. We wanted everyone to know
        the benefits of snuggling with a friendly cat and hearing their purrs.

        Kitties to Go! is committed to providing the best customer service and support. From
        the begining we knew cat lovers wanted to have a great experience with their furry friends.

        We are committed to supporting non profits who care for cats that have yet to find a home. 10% of
        our profits from each Kitty time is donated to a local shelter and veterinary clinic so they can
        get the best care possible.
